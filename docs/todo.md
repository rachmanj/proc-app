-   `[WIP]` - work in progress
-   `[blocked]` - blocked by dependency
-   `[testing]` - testing in progress
-   `[done]` - completed (add completion date)

### Priority Levels

-   `P0` - Critical (app won't work without this)

-   Warehouse management feature allows defining storage locations for items

-   This change helps with development on local environments while files exist only on production
